      	 of a vulnerability and produce a numerical score reflecting its severity. The numerical score can then be 
      	 translated into a qualitative representation (such as low, medium, high, and critical) to help organizations

      	or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. 
      	The result is that an application with more privileges than intended by the application developer or system

      	internal resources. The attacker can supply or a modify a URL which the code running on the server will read or submit 
      	data to, and by carefully selecting the URLs, the attacker may be able to read server configuration such as AWS metadata, 
      	connect to internal services like http enabled databases or perform post requests towards internal services 
      	which are not intended to be exposed.</p>

      <td>DOS</td>
      <td><p>In computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks
      	 to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting
      	 services of a host connected to the Internet. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted
      	 machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate
      	 requests from being fulfilled.In a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack), the incoming traffic 
      	 flooding the victim originates from many different sources. This effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack
      	 simply by blocking a single source.</p>
